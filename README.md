# RoRMod
## A huge nice mod for Risk of Rain 2
---
### What is this?
This is a mod for Risk of Rain 2, while it's in early access. Play around with it, it's great as a sandbox.

### How to I use it?
Go to the `Releases` tab, finding the latest release. You will download a zip file containing `RoRMod.dll` and `Assembly-CSharp.dll`. Both of theses files go into your `Risk of Rain 2_Data\Managed` directory.

To open the console, you will need to go to `Risk of Rain 2_Data\Config` and create a file called `autoexec.cfg`. This script is executed on startup. Put the line `console_enabled 1;` in it, and save. You can now press `~` (Tilde) in game to access the console.

Some commands require cheats to be enabled. Execute `cheats 1` to access these commands.

### Will this break on update?
Sadly so. I will try to push a new version as soon as a new update is relased.
